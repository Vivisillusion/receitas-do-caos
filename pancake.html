   <h1>4. Brazilian pancake</h1>
<p>This recipe was passed down to me by my best friend, who learned it from her mother, it was a Sunday tradition in their home. The scent of it alone feels like childhood in a frying pan.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 mug (or about 240ml) of milk</li>
  <li>1 mug of all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon of oil (plus more for the pan)</li>
  <li>A pinch of salt</li>
  <li>Your choice of filling: shredded meat, cheese and ham, cream cheese, butter, or whatever your wicked heart desires</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In a blender, combine the milk, flour, egg, oil, and salt. Blend until the batter is smooth.</li>
  <li>Heat a non-stick frying pan until it’s very hot — this is crucial. A properly heated pan is the secret to pancakes that don’t stick.</li>
  <li>Lightly grease the pan with oil. Pour a ladleful of batter and tilt the pan to spread it thinly and evenly.</li>
  <li>Cook until the edges lift and the bottom is golden. Flip and cook the other side.</li>
  <li>If the pancake begins to stick, add more oil. This recipe needs a generous amount of oil throughout — embrace it.</li>
  <li>Serve hot, stuffed with anything that feels like comfort. You deserve it.</li>
</ol>
